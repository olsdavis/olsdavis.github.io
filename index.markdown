Hi, I'm Oscar Davis, a third year PhD student in Machine Learning at the **University of Oxford**, supervised by [Prof Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/), [Dr İsmail Ceylan](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ismaililkan.ceylan/), and [Dr Joey Bose](https://joeybose.github.io/). My funding is generously provided by both [Project CETI](https://www.projectceti.org/) and Intel. My work primarily focuses on **generative modelling**.

From November 2023 until February 2024, I interned with **Microsoft Research, Cambridge**, where I worked on diffusion models, stable diffusion, and briefly neural ODEs. We did some internal theoretical work on these, analysing their SDEs and ODEs. (Patented.)

I hold a **BSc in Computer Science from EPFL** with an exchange year at Imperial College London, and an **MSc in Advanced Computer Science** from the **University of Oxford**. I was also awarded the **Tony Hoare Prize** for the **best MSc thesis of the year**, *Information Theoretic Perspectives on Graph Neural Networks*.
