Hi, I'm Oscar Davis, a third year PhD student in Machine Learning at the **University of Oxford**, supervised by [Prof Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/){:target="_blank"}, [Dr İsmail Ceylan](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ismaililkan.ceylan/){:target="_blank"}, and [Dr Joey Bose](https://joeybose.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. My funding is generously provided by both [Project CETI](https://www.projectceti.org/){:target="_blank"} and Intel. My work primarily focuses on **generative modelling**.

I am starting as a **Research Intern at Apple MLR, Paris**, in March 2026, under the supervision of [Prof Marco Cuturi](https://marcocuturi.net/){:target="_blank"}. From November 2023 until February 2024, I interned with **Microsoft Research, Cambridge**, where I worked on diffusion models, stable diffusion, and briefly neural ODEs. We did some internal theoretical work on these, analysing their SDEs and ODEs. (Patented.)

I hold a **BSc in Computer Science from EPFL** with an exchange year at Imperial College London, and an **MSc in Advanced Computer Science** from the **University of Oxford**. I was also awarded the **Tony Hoare Prize** for the **best MSc thesis of the year**, *Information Theoretic Perspectives on Graph Neural Networks*.

## IMM re-implementation
As the [Inductive Moment Matching paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07565){:target="_blank"} came out in March, I originally re-implemented it for FORT from scratch. Although it has been a while, I thought it would be useful to share the code, as it is efficient, modular and organised. You can find it here: [github.com/olsdavis/imm](https://github.com/olsdavis/imm){:target="_blank"}. Enjoy! :)
